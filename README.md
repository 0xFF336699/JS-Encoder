## Describeüñã

**JS-Encoder** gets some inspiration from [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com) and [CODEPEN](https://codepen.io/pen/), both of then are excellent online compiler. Built with Vue.js and Koa2.

In fact, JS-Encoder was released in its original version last year, but there were many shortcomings, so this year I rebuilt the JS-Encoder. If you want to see the old version, please go to: [The old version](https://www.lliiooiill.cn/jsencoder).

## Feature üåü

- [x] Live preview.
- [x] Support for a variety of front-end languages and pre-processing languages.
- [x] Support for external scripts and styles.
- [x] Cloud storage, you can login after the code to save in the cloud, easy to view and edit.
- [x] Local storage, where you can save code on the compiler locally, currently supports three forms:
  - Single file: A file include HTML, CSS and JS named index.html.
  - Zip: A zip file include HTML file, CSS file and JS file.
  - Preprocessing files: if you are using a preprocessing language, you can download a preprocessing language file that is not compiled.
- [x] File import, you can import the file from the local to the compiler, the compiler will automatically read the contents of the file and display in the edit window.
- [x] Support for multiple keyboard shortcuts, including the emmet extension.
- [x] Add markdown mode, support edit window and preview window real-time preview and synchronous scrolling, and add shortcut menu bar.

## Future ‚ùì

- **rebuild**, Vue3.0 is coming soon, with enhanced support for TypeScript, so TypeScript refactoring will be considered.
- **Preprocessor support**, JS-Encoder may support more front-end languages.
- **Code share**, share your code to another by urlüîó.
